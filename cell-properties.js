//************************Cell Formatting Bar Functionality started ****************************************/
/** Agenda
 * 1. Modifying Cell Properties
 * 2. Storing Property applied to individual Cells in a storage: As any cell can have any set of properties
 * 3. Two Way Binding : Both storage and UI needs to be changed to keep cells and Formatting bar in Sync
 */

/**
 * Storage of Properties
 * The cells can have their unique set of properties eg: bold, text-color etc.
 * The cells of the sheet can be represented by a 2D Array.
 * Since every cell has a set of properties, these properties can be stored in an object.
 * Therefore the 2D array will be like :
 * [
 *      [{}, {}, {}, ...],
 *      [{}, {}, {}, ...],
 *      ... and so on
 * ]
 * 2D Array -> SheetDB
